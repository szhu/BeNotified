_Desktop notifications for when it’s Time to BeReal!_

Keeping your phone next to you when you’re working can be distracting! If you’re a [BeReal](https://bereal.com/) user and want to leave your phone across the room or on airplane mode but still want to know when it’s ⚠️ Time to BeReal ⚠️, this (unofficial) Chrome extension can help.

This extension uses an unofficial BeReal API at [bereal.devin.fun](https://bereal.devin.fun/).

This extension is not affiliated with BeReal or devin.fun.

## How to install

1. Click the green **Code** button, and click **Download ZIP**.
2. In Chrome, go to: `chrome://extensions`
3. At the top-right, turn on **Developer mode**.
4. Click **Load unpacked**, then choose the folder you just downloaded. (Alternatively, drag the folder into the Chrome tab.)

## FAQ

### Is this on the Chrome Web Store?

No, but it wouldn’t be hard to publish it. Please [file an issue][issues] if you want this.

### Does this work on other browsers?

This extension works with desktop Chromium browsers, including Chrome, Edge, Opera, and Arc. Please [file an issue][issues] if you would like this available for non-Chromium browsers.

### Does this work on mobile?

No, but there is [an](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bereal-your-friends-for-real/id1459645446) [app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bereal.ft) you can download for that.

### Is there a way to use this without an API key?

Getting an API key from [bereal.devin.fun](https://bereal.devin.fun/) takes a while, which isn‘t ideal. I’m working on a solution that lets people use this extension immediately after installing it with no further configuration needed.

### Which time zone does this use?

This extension is currently hardcoded to use the Americas BeReal time zone, but it would not be hard to add an option to change the time zone. Please [file an issue][issues] if you would like this.
